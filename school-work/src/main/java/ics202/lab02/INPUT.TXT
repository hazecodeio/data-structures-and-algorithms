ics202 is a very interesting course.  
It teaches us data structures and some new interesting concepts.
Design patterns extends the idea of code reusability another step up.
All the lectures are ready online, so I can study at my time, at my pace, at my place, and for any number of times I need to.
How so wonderful!. 

There is a catch though.  The center has now shifted away from the instructor to me.
I now have to be responsible and discipline enough to study the material.  But such is life.  One has to be responsible to succeed.
